## CO2 Sequestration by Facility in the United States (2016-2022)
This dataset provides information on the total mass of CO2 sequestered by various facilities across the United States from 2016 to 2022. The data is sourced from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and includes the following details for each facility:
- Facility Name
- City
- State
- Zip Code
- Address
- County
- Latitude and Longitude coordinates
- Industry Type (subparts)
- Total Mass of CO2 Sequestered for each year from 2016 to 2022
- Date the data was reported for each year

The facilities included in this dataset are involved in various industries, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and gas processing. The dataset covers facilities located in several states, including Texas, Illinois, New Mexico, Wyoming, Michigan, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.

This dataset is valuable for researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists interested in understanding the trends and distribution of CO2 sequestration efforts in the United States. It can be used to analyze the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration technologies, identify the leading facilities and industries in CO2 sequestration, and monitor the progress of CO2 sequestration efforts over time.

Note: Some facilities may not have reported data for all years.
